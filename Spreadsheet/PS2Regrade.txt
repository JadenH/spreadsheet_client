Failing Tests:
- Test18
- Test18a
- Test32a
- Test41
- Test42
- Test43
- Test44
- Test45

My tests were failing for mainly two reasons.
1. I was not catching divide by zero. This caused test18 and test 18a to both fail. 
2. Some of my regex failed because it was not explicit enough. For instance, 3.0e0 was passing as a variable because it partially matched. This caused test32a to fail. This also caused the constructor tests (41-45) to fail.

Fixes:

I first fixed the dividing by zero to pass by throwing an exception. This was a simple fix that required one line in my operate method. I then worked on fixing the regex expressions by debugging to figure out which ones were failing. I then made the expressions work for those conditions, which usually meant making it match the whole line.
